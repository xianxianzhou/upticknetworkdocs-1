# Block Explorers

Read about the different types of block explorers on Uptick. {synopsis}

## Introduction

Blockchain explorers allow users to query the blockchain for data. Explorers are often compared to search engines for the blockchain. By using an explorer, users can search and track balances, transactions, contracts, and other broadcasted data to the blockchain.

Uptick offers two types block explorers: an EVM explorer and a Cosmos explorer. Each explorer queries data respective to their environment with the EVM explorers querying Ethereum-formatted data (blocks, transactions, accounts, smart contracts etc) and the Cosmos explorers querying Cosmos-formatted data (Cosmoss and IBC transactions, blocks, accounts, module data, etc).
